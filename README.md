Hey! I'm Mark Davidson :wave:
I am a student software engineer, currently studying BSc Computer Science at Ulster University, Belfast.
Professionally, I have a Fd in Computer Science from Northern Regional College, awarded in 2019.
I am from Northern Ireland and enjoy working on code in my free time.
In the spring of 2019 I had a 16 week placement at Version 1, one of Irelands largest software companies where I was a full stack developer working in a small team working on an project estimating app for internal use. This has since been rolled out and used company wide to help consultants help give accurate estimations for the resources (time & money) required for a project. I learn valuable communication skills from this, and language specific skills in the .NET framework using razer views at a full stack scope.
Aside from professionally, I enjoy building and working on cars,specifically imports, have a keen interest in football and give up a lot of my time to help volunteer to help local youth through summer Bible camps and volunteer as an officer at the boys brigade.

Language experience:  Java, PHP, HTML, Javascript, SQL, Python, C#, jquery etc.
Competency in tools such as sql server, team foundation server, git etc.
